    "longDescription3": "The app uses a few different frameworks: React for the frontend pages, Express and MongoDB for the backend functionality and database, all wrapped in a Django application to tie it together.",
    "longDescription4": "The project also included containerizing the ExpressMongo services using Docker and deploying a sentiment analyzer microservice from the IBM Cloud Code Engine.  CI/CD workflows using GitHub were added for linting and packaging.  Then the application was deployed using Kubernetes for container management."
